Some time along your career as a scientist, you will have to document your findings. You may have already encounted the fancy looking documents of these findings
either on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) where all of the prepublication physics documents are stored, or elsewhere. More than Likely, these documents were produced using a program called
[LateX](https://www.latex-project.org/), pronounced "Lah-tech", that the scientific community uses to produce professional papers. There is a website called [Overleaf.com](https://overleaf.com) that
provides an online area for you to write up these documents. You can even link it to your github account so that you may produce backups of your work and version it.
There are a few ways to use LateX, you can either use overleaf, or download the latex software yourself and create your documents there. The reason for the 2 methods
of use is because LateX uses computing resources to transform ordinary looking text, into the fancy stuff that you see in the papers, And so when you choose to use
overleaf, youre using thier cloud computers to compile this text. If you download LateX for yourself, you can use your own computer to compile the text and make the
document. This becomes useful if you have a very large document with figures and chapters that will take a while to compile, you may be better off in that case using 
your own computer to compile the text, instead of using Overleaf's limited resources, which are good for small to medium projects.

Here is an example of a LateX document
