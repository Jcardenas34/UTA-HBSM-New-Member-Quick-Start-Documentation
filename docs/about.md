# HBSM Group at UTA

## The Need for More

This documentation was created out of the necessity to get new undergraduate as
well as new Graduate students ready to do research as fast as possible. At the start
There was very little if any documentation on how to use critical software
necessary to become a particle physicist. Such as how to use ROOT, where to 
find papers, where to go to learn to code in C++ and python or even how to use 
the Tier3 cluster here at UTA much less about what it is or where its located.
 It is my idea that if I can provide a central place where all of this information is located,
I can expidite the progress of this group, as well as the HEP (High Energy Physics)
Community here at UTA.


People will come and go at UTA, but [here](https://www.uta.edu/physics/people/index.php)
are the current students and faculty you will become aquainted with.

As a User to this documentation, I ask you, please help contribute to this document so that UTA's Physics Department
can grow stonger, closer, and more competative in the coming years, by helping students who are learning, just like you,
understand how to become a physicist.
