# Accelerating your work flow

When I first started out, I was making all of my file edits through the emacs command in the
terminal. And although emacs is a very powerful text editor, it can get a little bit difficult to work with
when youre using it remotely, It does not support any in window mouse clicks and it occupies the entire terminal window
while youre working, making you unable to view the files and directory name that youre working in. and maybe you want to use a 
text editor that has a lot more features, and not be tied down to using emacs, although you will definitly have to use emacs for 
quicker edits.

It turns out there is a way that you can edit files on a remote server while using the text editor of your choice, through an 
sftp software called [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)
