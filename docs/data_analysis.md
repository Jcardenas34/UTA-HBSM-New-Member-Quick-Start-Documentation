Data Analysis
=====================

Much of the basics of a particle physics analysis can be found in this document. Chapter 3 is especially immuminating to the meaning of 5 sigma. The level of certianty that we must reach in LHC experiments to claim a discovery.

When starting a project, you must first be able to access the data that you will be using, for this ATLAS uses what we call the AMI, the ATLAS Metadata Interface. This is a tool to 
find datasets and obtain detailed information on them.
