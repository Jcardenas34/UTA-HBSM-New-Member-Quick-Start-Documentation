# Getting Started with Github

![github logo](/docs/img/github-logo.png)

Git hub, is a way for you to store your files on free online cloud server, as well as a way for multiple people
to make changes to the same piece of software. Lots of Groups in ATLAS use github because that have many members that need
to work towards the same project. Lets say that there is a big project that needs to be worked on that has multiple sections,
Some people work on a graphical user interface, some on key user functions and other on making the program handicap compatible.
It is impossible for one team to work on all of these components at once so the work is split into groups so that each group
works on a major component, but in the end all components are combined to give you a final working product. This is where
github becomes useful.

If there is a physics project that you need to work on with someone, you can create a git repository
(A place to store the code on the github website) where you can both download an intial version of the code, work on it
and then push it back to a "master" file at the end of the day.

So thats it for an introduction, I think this video series is pretty good at explaining what git and github is 
and how to use it. [Learn Git/Github here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjQznt-8kE&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9goXbgTDQ0n_4TBzOO0ocPR)
