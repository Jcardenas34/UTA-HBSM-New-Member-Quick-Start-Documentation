# Charged Higgs UTA 
# Quick Start Documentation

![CPB](img/CPB_at_UTA.jpg)


The way that this documentation is structured is in a series of links.
Very many resources That I used to learn the practicle skills needed to do Particle Physics 
were from random internet links and not books. So very often the resource that I found most helpful, wether it be
a reference document, a video series on youtube, or a tutorial outlining steps will look like this. 

[Take the first step...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2atQnvunGCo)
It's a link to cool LO-FI music that you can listen to

Take what you can from these links, and add new ones to this document if you feel youve learned more from it.
Our general meetings that take place every tuesday and Friday have a page where we post our results for the week
as well as a link to the video calling software that we use when we are unable to meet physically [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/884412/)

ask us for the password to the page, as it is unwise to post it in a public place like this.

## Works in progress
All of it but specifically id like to add
More about ATLAS and our
charged higgs process, super symmetry and all that
the ATLAS detector
 how to write a paper using overleaf or Latex
 Where to find papers
group matter most

Getting started with a CERN account
Vidyo
Common practices tools and resources people in the collaboration use
like vidyo and indico
