# Charged Higgs UTA 
# Quick Start Documentation


The way that this documentation is structured is in a series of links.
Very many resources That I used to learn the practicle skills needed to do Particle Physics 
were from random internet links and not books. So very often the resource that I found most helpful, wether it be
a reference document, a video series on youtube, or a tutorial outlining steps will look like this.
