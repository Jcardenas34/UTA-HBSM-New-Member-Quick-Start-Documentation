# Coding Languages and the Command Line

![Terminal](/docs/img/terminal_mac.webp) ![python logo](docs/img/python_logo.png)

Everyone starts out with a diffent level of experience with coding, If you take me for example
I came into the Graduate program here knowing little to nothing about how to code, just basic for loops
and varible declarations. But In joining the High Energy Community you will no doubt have to become a master
In 2 programming languages they are [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/info/description/) and
[Python](https://docs.python.org/2/). Where I have linked the sources to thier documentation in the links there.

But before you can embark on your jouney in learning these programming languaes, you must learn 
[How to navigate your command prompt](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell)
This is what will let you take your first steps so to say, It is what will allow you to run the C++ 
and Python scripts that you write, as well as copy files to and from other computers.


After you feel like you can do the very basic commands out of muscle memory, such as creating files and directories,
moving and copying those files you can start learning about the coding languages we use on a daily basis, Python and C++.
I have listed Python first because we have recently switched to the use of python becuse it is more understandable and easier to use than C++,
Although it is very important that you become skilled in both of these languages. Some of the you tube series that helped me get familiar with python are [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU) 

and C++ [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvC1WCdV1XU&list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83)

Dont get me wrong, these series of videos are VERY long, and will take a while to get through them, but by the end you will have a better 
understanding of how to write code in these languages. And please, dont feel like you have to watch these videos sequentially from start to finish,
skip around and watch the ones you have questions about.
