## Python and C++ our Main Programming Languages

![pythonlogo](img/python_logo.png)

There are certian programming languages that people use for differnt project types, for example,
if you were to try and build a website you might want to learn to code in HTML or if you were in Data science it might
be useful to learn the R programming language.

It just so happens that in Particle physics, the 2 programming languages that are most useful to us are
C++ and Python. C++ for its speed in large projects and compatability with ROOT (Which youll learn about later),
and Python, for its ease of use, compatability with common machine learning software such as Keras and Tensorflow as well
as its increaced simplicity when using ROOT. Like I said previously, Its very useful to get to a working proficiency 
with both languages but our group has recently trasitioned to working with Python, as it is easier to use with ROOT, and for 
our Neural Network projects. So where can you learn how to code in these languages?

Some of the youtube series that helped me get familiar with Python are [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU) 
and C++ [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvC1WCdV1XU&list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83)

Dont get me wrong, these series of videos are VERY long, and will take a while to get through them, 
but by the end you will have a better understanding of how to write code in these languages. 
And please, dont feel like you have to watch these videos sequentially from start to finish,
skip around and watch the ones you have questions about.
