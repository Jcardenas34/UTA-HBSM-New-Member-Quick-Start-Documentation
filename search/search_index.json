At the start There was very little if any documentation on how to use critical software necessary to become a particle physicist. Such as how to use ROOT, where to find papers, where to go to learn to code in C++ and python or even how to use the Tier3 cluster here at UTA much less about what it is or where its located. It is my idea that if I can provide a central place where all of this information is located, I can expidite the progress of this group, as well as the HEP (High Energy Physics) Community here at UTA. People will come and go at UTA, but here are the current students and faculty you will become aquainted with. As a User to this documentation, I ask you, please help contribute to this document so that UTA's Physics Department can grow stonger, closer, and more competative in the coming years, by helping students who are learning, just like you, understand how to become a physicist.

But In joining the High Energy Community you will no doubt have to become a master In 2 programming languages they are C++ and Python . Where I have linked the sources to thier documentation in the links there. But before you can embark on your jouney in learning these programming languaes, you must learn How to navigate your command prompt This is what will let you take your first steps so to say, It is what will allow you to run the C++ and Python scripts that you write, as well as copy files to and from other computers. After you feel like you can do the very basic commands out of muscle memory, such as creating files and directories, moving and copying those files you can start learning about the coding languages we use on a daily basis, Python and C++. I have listed Python first because we have recently switched to the use of python becuse it is more understandable and easier to use than C++, Although it is very important that you become skilled in both of these languages. Some of the you tube series that helped me get familiar with python are here and C++ here Dont get me wrong, these series of videos are VERY long, and will take a while to get through them, but by the end you will have a better understanding of how to write code in these languages. And please, dont feel like you have to watch these videos sequentially from start to finish, skip around and watch the ones you have questions about.","title":"Command Line"},{"location":"coding/#coding-languages-and-the-command-line","text":"Everyone starts out with a diffent level of experience with coding, If you take me for example I came into the Graduate program here knowing little to nothing about how to code, just basic for loops and varible declarations.

Lots of Groups in ATLAS use github because that have many members that need to work towards the same project. Lets say that there is a big project that needs to be worked on that has multiple sections, Some people work on a graphical user interface, some on key user functions and other on making the program handicap compatible. It is impossible for one team to work on all of these components at once so the work is split into groups so that each group works on a major component, but in the end all components are combined to give you a final working product. This is where github becomes useful. If there is a physics project that you need to work on with someone, you can create a git repository (A place to store the code on the github website) where you can both download an intial version of the code, work on it and then push it back to a \"master\" file at the end of the day.","title":"Github"},{"location":"github/#getting-started-with-github","text":"Git hub, is a way for you to store your files on free online cloud server, as well as a way for multiple people to make changes to the same piece of software.
